    Searches `package` itself first, then each installed package that depends on

    `package` is located (e.g., `pyrig.rig` becomes `<dep>.rig`), and every

    that depends on that root (e.g., `myapp.rig.configs`), imports it if it

    The root package itself is not included in results — only its dependents are
    iterated. The path transformation replaces the first occurrence of the root
    package name in `module.__name__` with each dependent package's name, so a
    consistent directory structure across the ecosystem is assumed.

    Args:
